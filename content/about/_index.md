I am a rising junior at Arizona State University. I am a noob trying to get into vulnerability research and exploit development while balancing my time participating in CTFs with [Shellphish](https://shellphish.net/), [ASU Hacking Club](http://asuhacking.club/), or sometimes solo, doing cool research at [SEFCOM](https://sefcom.asu.edu/), and well completing assignments.

The following Sanskrit shloka was taught to me by my mother and everyday I try to apply it's teaching in my life.

<p style="font-size:1.2em; text-align: center; ">विद्या ददाति विनयं विनयाद्याति पात्रताम् ।<br>पात्रत्वाद्धनमाप्नोति धनाद्धर्मं ततः सुखम् ॥ </p>

**English meaning:** knowledge gives discipline, from discipline comes worthiness, from worthiness one gets wealth, from wealth one does good deeds, from that comes the happiness.
